Re:Edit

Client-server, in browser, code editor based on concept of shifting "boards"


Diagram of sifting boards:
     
         ^ up 
       board 1   board 2  board 3     ...
     -----------         ----------- 
     |         |         |         |
     | pad   1 |---------| pad   4 |
  <  |         |         |         |  >
     ----------- pad   3 |         |
     |         |         |         |
     | pad   2 |---------|         |
     |         |         |         |
     -----------         ----------- 
       \/ down
         

Boards contains pads. Pads can be attached to each other through pins. When pads shift so do the boards according to pinning strategy.

This concept lossly based on sort of code bubbles (http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/acb/codebubbles_site.htm) but instead of a free flowing mess everything is constrained to boards and pad grids.
